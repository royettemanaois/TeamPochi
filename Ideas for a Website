1. A poll website. (YouPoll)
	- a poll website for SLU. Students can post a poll about something and students can participate in these polls. This can be used
      by irregular students. Some irregular students want to petition for a particular subject and they need to post the news to 
      the facebook page of SLU or a certain school of SLU. This would be better if this has an individual site for those matters.

2. A foreign language tutorial website. (Nani)
	- since there are already foreign language subjects in some courses, it is good that they have this website for extra
	learning. This website will contain tutorials and a free-board that they can draw symbols and write something.
	
3. Skill Trading (SkillSet Trade)
	- this website will contain people who will post their skillset and what they can do. Then other people will go there
	and find someone who can solve their problem. But the payment method here is unique because they will not pay money
	but instead, they will do something to that man/woman in exchange.
