1. A poll website.
	- a poll website for SLU. Students can post a poll about something and students can participate in these polls. This can be used
      by irregular students. Some irregular students want to petition for a particular subject and they need to post the news to 
      the facebook page of SLU or a certain school of SLU. This would be better if this has an individual site for those matters.

2. A foreign language tutorial website.
	- since there are already foreign language subjects in some courses, it is good that they have this website for extra
	learning. This website will contain tutorials and a free-board that they can draw symbols and write something.
